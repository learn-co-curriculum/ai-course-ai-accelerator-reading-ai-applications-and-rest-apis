# ðŸ“š Reading: AI Applications & REST APIs

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>APIs for Artificial Intelligence provide a structured interface that allows developers to integrate pre-trained AI models and algorithms into their applications with ease. These APIs abstract away the complexities of AI implementation, providing a standardized way to interact with AI capabilities. They enable developers to leverage sophisticated AI functionalities without the need for in-depth knowledge of AI algorithms or extensive computational resources.</p>
<p>One popular framework for building APIs, particularly for AI models, is Flask-RESTful. Flask-RESTful is an extension of the Flask web framework for Python that simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs. It provides a set of tools and abstractions specifically designed for building APIs, making it an excellent choice for exposing AI models through a web API.</p>
<p>By combining Flask-RESTful with AI APIs, developers can create powerful and scalable AI-powered applications. Flask-RESTful handles the request and response handling, URL routing, and error management, while the AI API handles the underlying AI functionalities, such as natural language understanding, image recognition, or predictive analytics. This combination allows developers to focus on building the application logic while leveraging the capabilities of AI models.</p>

<h2>AI Applications</h2>
<h3>Define API</h3>
<p>An API, or application programming interface, is a manner in which companies and organizations, like Twitter or the New York City government, expose their data and/or functionality to the public (i.e. talented programmers like yourself) for use. APIs allow us to add important data and functionality to the applications we build. Here's just a few examples of some of the cool things you can do by using APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an app that allows users to sign up/sign in via Facebook/Google/Twitter/Github/etc.</li>
<li>Use the NYC Open Data API to get and map dataâ€“â€“everything from Health Department restaurant ratings to public park locations and hours to New York City Public Housing repair issues to noise complaints to public school construction, you name it!</li>
<li>Use the Yelp API to find and deliver popular local spots to your users.</li>
<li>Use the Weather Underground API to give your users up-to-date weather alerts.</li>
<li>Use the Ticket Master API to inform your users if their favorite musician has an upcoming show.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a small sample of what working with APIs allows us to do as developers. Throughout the course of your programming life, you'll likely be exposed to working with many different APIs. This reading seeks to introduce the topic, emphasize some of the benefits of getting comfortable working with APIs and offer a brief intro into some of the common methods of working with APIs.</p>
<h3>An overview of APIs</h3>
<p>APIs are a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information, perform specific actions, or access services provided by another software component, such as a library, framework, or web service.</p>
<p>Here are some key points about APIs:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Communication between software components</strong>: APIs provide a standardized way for software components to communicate and interact with each other. They define the contract or interface that developers can use to access and utilize the functionalities and resources offered by the API provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Abstraction and encapsulation</strong>: APIs abstract away the complex implementation details of a software component, exposing only the necessary functionality and hiding internal workings. This allows developers to use the API without needing to understand the underlying complexities, making development more efficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Building blocks for development</strong>: APIs serve as building blocks that developers can leverage to enhance their applications or create new software solutions. By integrating APIs, developers can leverage existing functionality, services, or data sources, saving time and effort in implementing those functionalities from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Types of APIs</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Web APIs</em>: These APIs enable communication between different web-based applications or services. They often follow web standards like HTTP and use protocols such as REST (Representational State Transfer) or GraphQL. You'll use a type of REST API next.</li>
<li><em>Library or Framework APIs</em>: These APIs are part of libraries or frameworks and provide access to specific functionalities or resources. They are typically used by developers within their applications to leverage pre-built capabilities.</li>
<li><em>Operating System APIs</em>: These APIs provide a way for applications to interact with the underlying operating system, accessing system resources, services, and hardware.</li>
<li><em>Database APIs</em>: These APIs facilitate communication with databases, allowing applications to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.</li>
<li><em>Hardware APIs</em>: These APIs enable interaction with hardware components or devices, providing access to sensors, cameras, printers, and other peripherals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Request and response:</strong> APIs operate on a request-response model. The requesting application (client) sends a request to the API with specific parameters or data, and the API processes the request and sends back a response containing the requested information or the result of the operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Documentation</strong>: APIs are typically accompanied by documentation that provides information on how to use the API, including details about available endpoints, methods, parameters, data formats, authentication requirements, and error handling. Good documentation helps developers understand and integrate with the API effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>API versioning</strong>: APIs may have different versions to accommodate changes, updates, or backward compatibility. Versioning allows developers to ensure that their applications can continue to function correctly even as the API evolves over time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, APIs are essential tools for enabling communication and integration between different software components. They provide a standardized way to access functionalities, services, or data, allowing developers to build more powerful and interconnected applications.</p>
<h3>How to Work with APIs</h3>
<p>Different APIs expose their data and functionalities in different ways. However, there are commonalities among them and there are common approaches that we'll discuss here. Generally speaking, there are two main uses for APIsâ€“â€“getting data and adding functionality (e.g. signing in with Facebook or posting to Instagram). We'll be discussing the "getting data" part of working with APIs here.</p>
<p>Many APIs are built on what is referred to as a REST-ful framework. That means that the "endpoints", or URLs to which we can send a request for data, follow certain conventions. These URLs should allow you to request information, send information, update information and delete information. Let's focus on the "getting information" request.</p>
<h3>AI and APIs</h3>
<p>An Artificial Intelligence (AI) API, also known as a Machine Learning (ML) API, is an interface that allows developers to access and utilize pre-trained AI models and algorithms through a standardized set of methods and protocols. It provides a convenient way to integrate AI capabilities into applications, services, or systems without having to build and train the AI models from scratch.</p>
<p>An AI API typically exposes functionalities related to various AI tasks such as natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, and more. These APIs are built on top of AI frameworks or platforms that provide the underlying infrastructure and resources for training and deploying AI models.</p>
<p>Here are some key aspects of an AI API:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Input and output data: An AI API expects specific input data, which could be in the form of text, images, audio, or other relevant formats, depending on the task it is designed for. The API processes this input data using the underlying AI model and returns the output, which could be predictions, classifications, analysis results, or any other relevant information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pre-trained models: AI APIs are typically built on top of pre-trained AI models that have been trained on large datasets to perform specific tasks accurately. These models encapsulate the knowledge and patterns learned during the training process and can be used to make predictions or provide insights based on new input data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standardized interfaces: AI APIs provide standardized interfaces, often based on industry standards or common conventions, to ensure consistency and ease of integration. These interfaces define the methods, parameters, and expected input/output formats that developers can use to interact with the AI capabilities provided by the API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scalability and performance: AI APIs are designed to handle multiple requests simultaneously and provide responses in a timely manner. They leverage scalable infrastructure and optimization techniques to handle a large number of concurrent requests efficiently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authentication and security: AI APIs often require authentication mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users or applications can access and use the API. This helps protect the AI models and resources from unauthorized access and misuse.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documentation and support: AI APIs typically come with comprehensive documentation and developer guides that provide information on how to use the API, including details about input/output formats, available functionalities, usage examples, and error handling. Additionally, API providers may offer support channels for developers to seek assistance or report issues related to the API usage.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>AI APIs democratize access to AI capabilities, allowing developers to leverage powerful AI models and algorithms without needing deep expertise in AI or extensive computational resources. They enable the integration of AI functionality into a wide range of applications, services, and systems, driving innovation and enhancing user experiences across various industries.</p>
<h2>Flask</h2>
<h3>An overview of Flask</h3>
<p>Flask is a lightweight web framework for Python that allows you to build web applications easily and quickly. It is considered a micro-framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries to function, giving you the flexibility to choose the components you need for your project. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/" target="_blank">Flask documentation can be found with this link</a>.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/ai-course-ai-accelerator-reading-ai-applications-and-rest-apis/blob/main/flask.png" alt="Symbol of Flask, which is an old fashioned flask made out of a horn and the word Flask." data-api-endpoint="https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/6995/files/4132234" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
<h4>A brief history of Flask</h4>
<p>Flask was originally developed by <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/">Armin Ronacher</a> as an April Fool's joke in 2010. His goal was to make the smallest viable web framework and pitch it for use in production code. He leveraged some of his other projects in the process: <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/werkzeug/">Werkzeug</a> (German for "work stuff") as an interface between the application and server, <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/">Jinja</a> to turn Python code into HTML, and <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/">Click</a>, a CLI building tool that we mentioned at the end of Phase 3.</p>
<p>Competing with the well-established and generally beloved Django, he felt that his proposal would be met with a laugh. After all, Flask didn't do very much. All of the source code fit comfortably into one file! Much to Ronacher's surprise, people loved Flask and began submitting hundreds of pull requests on the repo, suggesting changes to expand its core functionality and compatibility with different styles of coding.</p>
<p>Ronacher couldn't handle all of these requests himself, so he created <a href="https://palletsprojects.com/">the Pallets Projects</a> as a central location for Flask and his other projects. If you visit the homepage, you'll see the docs for Werkzeug, Jinja, and Click.</p>
<p>Because it is useful for small and large projects and a wide variety of tasks, Flask is now the most used Python web framework: It is used at Netflix, Reddit, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, and Mozilla, among many, many other companies. Flask isn't the perfect tool for every task, but we will explore several common use cases and introduce you to many generalizable key concepts in full-stack web development.</p>
<h4>Key Features of Flask</h4>
<p>Here are some key features of Flask:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Routing</strong>: Flask provides a routing mechanism that allows you to map URLs to Python functions. You can define routes using decorators, making it easy to handle different HTTP methods and request parameters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HTTP request handling</strong>: Flask provides request and response handling capabilities, allowing you to access incoming request data and send appropriate responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Template engine</strong>: Flask integrates with Jinja2, a powerful template engine that allows you to separate the presentation logic from the business logic of your application. You can define templates with placeholders, and Flask will render them with the desired data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>RESTful request handling:</strong> Flask can be used to build RESTful APIs by defining routes that handle different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and respond with the appropriate data. This is what you'll be doing in your lab next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Extensions</strong>: Flask has a rich ecosystem of extensions that provide additional functionality. These extensions can be easily integrated into your Flask application to add features such as database integration, user authentication, caching, and more.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Lightweight and flexible:</strong> Flask is designed to be lightweight and flexible, allowing you to choose the components you need and leaving out the ones you don't. This makes it a great choice for small to medium-sized projects or building specific components of larger applications.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, Flask provides a simple and intuitive way to build web applications and APIs using Python. It has a low barrier to entry and allows you to start small and expand as your project grows.</p>
<h3>An overview of Flask-RESTful</h3>
<p>A Flask-RESTful API is an extension of the Flask web framework that simplifies the process of building RESTful APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) in Python. It provides a set of tools and abstractions that make it easier to define API endpoints, handle requests and responses, and manage resources. <a class="inline_disabled" href="https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Flask-RESTful documentation can be found with this link</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://github.com/learn-co-curriculum/ai-course-ai-accelerator-reading-ai-applications-and-rest-apis/blob/main/flask-restful.png" alt="The avatar for Flask-RESTful which is a resting cat that appears to have ben hand-drawn with pencil." width="528" height="368" data-api-endpoint="https://learning.flatironschool.com/api/v1/courses/6995/files/4132235" data-api-returntype="File"></p>
<p>Here are some key features and concepts of Flask-RESTful:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Resource-based approach: Flask-RESTful follows a resource-centric design, where each API endpoint corresponds to a specific resource or a collection of resources. A resource can be thought of as an object or entity that you want to expose through your API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Class-based views: With Flask-RESTful, you define your API endpoints as classes that inherit from the <code>flask_restful.Resource</code> class. Each class represents a specific resource and contains methods corresponding to different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that can be performed on that resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request parsing and validation: Flask-RESTful provides built-in request parsing and validation mechanisms. You can easily define the expected request parameters, data types, and validation rules for each endpoint. This simplifies the process of handling incoming requests and ensures the data is in the expected format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content negotiation: Flask-RESTful handles content negotiation, allowing the API to respond with different data representations based on the client's requested format (e.g., JSON, XML, etc.). It automatically handles serialization and deserialization of data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error handling: Flask-RESTful provides a convenient way to handle errors and exceptions that may occur during API requests. You can define custom error handlers to provide meaningful responses and error messages to clients.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>URL routing: Flask-RESTful integrates with Flask's routing system, allowing you to define API endpoints using decorators or by explicitly adding routes to the API instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extension of Flask: Flask-RESTful is an extension of Flask, which means you can leverage all the features and capabilities of Flask while building your API. This includes using Flask's templating system, database integration, authentication mechanisms, and more.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By using Flask-RESTful, you can focus on defining your API endpoints and the logic to handle different requests and responses, without worrying about the lower-level details of parsing requests, serializing data, and handling errors. It provides a streamlined and organized approach to building RESTful APIs with Flask</p>
